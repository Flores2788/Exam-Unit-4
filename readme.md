Step 1 done.
Step 2: created game class in models file. I used constructor function to create a new instance (game), so when it receives an object it unpacks its properties into variables. At the end I added a method that summarizes the game.
Step 3: Implemented functions that retrieve, export and save games from localStorage. Also added all the examples from the json file provided.
Step 4: Added file reader that imports JSON data to localStorage and populate in-memory array
Step 5: added visual records of games with range button and button UI
Step 6: done.
step 7: added ui and wrote code that handles form submission.
